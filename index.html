      <p>Hello, I chose hobbies to well describe my hobbies, my hobbies are playing videogames, building computers, playing soccer, cooking and playing my trombone. I like these hobbies because they are the most entertaining and fun and it can be interesting.</p>
      <p>I like to build computers because it can be relaxing, fun, and stressful all at the same time, the way it can be stressful is that you have to be careful on how you plug in your components and have to be really careful that you dont bend anything or brake something off, fun because well youre building a computer and its something that not many people do but its just the excitement on how it will look once you complete building the computer, and it could be relaxing because once you have been building computers it just feels natural on where the components lie on and just seeing what you have built all by yourself.</p>
      <p>Apart from building computers I like to also play games I try to play every game I see to see if I enjoy that type of game and usually its a good game but my prefferred genre is FPS games and Soullike games, so for example Call of duty, Borderlands, Dark Souls those are the games I like to play the most and those are the games I mainly grew up playing.</p>

      <p>My identity I have chosen for this class is the "Ashen One" My mission is To hunt down the Lords of Cinder who have abandoned their thrones and return them to Firelink Shrine, so the cycle of fire and dark can continue—or be broken.</p>
      <p>I chose this identity because of a game called Dark Souls and this is a rpg/soullike game and I just enjoy playing the game.</p>
      <p>Another reason on why I have chose this avatar for this class was that I wasnt really too sure on what to choose and I really wanted to look for something that stood out to me but also that wasnt very common, so I chose "Ashened One" from dark souls its a nice little tittle that the game has created and it doesnt sound generic to me.</p>

      <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
      <p>I am learning Computer Science, I am taking this class because it is a required class in the program I am in to graduate with my associates degree.</p>
      <p>I am also taking this class because I would like to create websites and also have a deeper understanding on how are websites created and the amount of time people take to create them.</p>
      <p>This class peaked my interest because Its nice to know that you have created your own website and nobody can take that away from you because you choose the design of the webpage, how would look, and its layout on where do you want your things to show up and why do you want them there, because there are times where I spend so much time on a website to look for a specific link and I just hate how its all layedout so I would to know how to really make one that makes sense to me and hopefully in the future to other people.</p>
